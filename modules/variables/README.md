# Data Types, Variables, & Expressions

## Objectives

- Python data types
- Working with varaibles
- Operators
- Expressions
- Input & output
- Comments

## Example code

### variables.py

Introduces variables and constants

### datatypes.py

Introduces the different built-in data types in Python (int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, dict, set, complex) with printed examples

### operator.py

[Video link](https://youtu.be/bKY3fD2wczA) (2:49) Examples of using the arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **) and how they behave with numbers

### expressions.py

Builds on operators.py by showing more complex formulas and compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=)

### comparison.py

Introduces the comparison and logical operators (==, !=, <, >, and, or, not)
.

### comments.py

Demonstration of good documentation practices: clear naming, inline comments, and docstrings while doing a simple circle area calculation

### inputoutput.py

Interact with the user: getting input with input() and displaying results with print() and f-strings

### ex1calculator.py

Putting it all together: input, arithmetic, and output to create a simple calculator program

### moduleinfo.py

Code examples from the module introduction video

### shoppingcart.py

A capstone example: integrates variables, operators, input, and formatting into a practical program that generates a receipt.  Also uses loops which we will cover later.
